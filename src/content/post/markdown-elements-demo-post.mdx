# Bombay High Court: Dismissal of Petition Challenging Promotion Orders of Naval Staff

## Case Background

In a writ petition filed by 25 serving and ex-Navy staff members aggrieved of a judgment of the Central Administrative Tribunal, Mumbai ("Tribunal") regarding alleged discrepancies in the promotions of the petitioners made by the respondent, the Division Bench of Devendra Kumar Upadhyaya, CJ.* and Dr. Arif S. Doctor, J, upheld the Tribunal judgment, finding the petitioners' allegations bereft of material support.

### Petitioners' Contentions

- The petitioners were employed as Artisan Staff [in the grades of Skilled, Highly Skilled-I ("HSK-I"), and Highly Skilled-II ("HSK-II")], and Technical Supervisory Staff (in the grades of Chargeman and Foreman) with the Indian Navy.
- The Ministry of Defence ("MoD") had created a grade of Master Craftsman in each trade, and in 2010, restructured the total cadre of Artisan Staff from three degrees to four degrees, placing Master Craftsman on the top.
- The petitioners contended that the promotions of Technical Supervisors had been carried out as per the trade-wise seniority, whereas the promotions of the Artisan Staff had been carried out as per the combined seniority of all trades, resulting in a shortage of Master Craftsmen promotable to Chargemen.
- A few petitioners were promoted directly from HSK-I to Chargeman, bypassing the promotion to Master Craftsman, depriving them of the loss of one increment they could have earned through pay fixation.
- The petitioners made representations to respondent no. 2 in 2017, seeking that the promotions of Artisan Staff be carried out as per the trade-wise seniority roster, which were rejected.

## Court's Analysis and Judgment

### Delay and Acquiescence

- The Court found the case purely academic because many petitioners had already been promoted as per the OM, and having acquiesced to the same, they were estopped from challenging it.
- The Court agreed with the Tribunal's finding regarding the delay of six years by the petitioners in issuing grievances, and held that no direction could have been given at such a delayed stage that would have upset the pre-fixed seniority.

### Absence of Specific Restrictions on Promotion Manner

- The Court clarified that the previous orders challenged by the petitioners did not provide for the preparation of a seniority list or for the manner in which promotions were to be granted, but for the restructuring of the Artisan Staff.
- The Court found that the relevant Recruitment Rules did not specify that promotions were to be made trade-wise only and not grade-wise.
- The Court held that in the absence of any specific bar on the powers of respondent no. 2 with respect to promotions, the latter was empowered to grant promotions trade-wise or grade-wise, as per their requirement and policy decisions.

### Lack of Material Support

- The Court noted that the mere ipse dixit of the petitioners regarding the prejudice and monetary loss caused to them was not supported by any material evidence, as not even a single instance of a junior employee being promoted before a senior employee was presented.

### Decision

The Court, therefore, held the petitioners' contentions entirely bereft of any material support and dismissed the petition accordingly.
