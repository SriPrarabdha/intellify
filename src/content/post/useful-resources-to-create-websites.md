# Andhra Pradesh High Court: Application for Extension of Passing Arbitral Award Maintainable Only Before Court u/s 2(1)(e) of Arbitration Act

## Case Background

An application was filed by the applicants under Section 29-A of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 ('the Act') seeking extension of the mandate of the arbitral tribunal for passing an Award.

The Division Bench of Dhiraj Singh Thakur, CJ.* and A.V. Sesha Sai, J., opined that if a court making a reference under Section 11(6) of the Act became functus officio, the question of seeking an extension in terms of Section 29-A of the Act from the High Court or the Supreme Court, assuming that it had passed the initial order of reference, would not arise except where the High Court was vested with original jurisdiction, which in any case the Andhra Pradesh High Court was not vested with.

### Background

- NRI Academy of Sciences ('NRIAS'), a society registered under the Andhra Pradesh Societies Registration Act, 2001 ran a medical college and nursing homes.
- By order dated 22-02-2022, disputes regarding the management of NRIAS were referred to an arbitral tribunal comprising of Justice Devinder Gupta as the sole Arbitrator.
- Respondents raised a preliminary objection regarding the maintainability of the applications under Section 29A of the Act, stating that it should have been filed before the Principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction in the District Court and not before the High Court.

### Issue

The issue for consideration was whether the present applicants seeking extension of the mandate of the arbitral tribunal under Section 29A of the Act were maintainable before the High Court or not.

## Analysis, Law, and Decision

### Reliance on K.V. Ramana Reddy Case

The Court observed that in various decisions by several High Courts, reliance was placed on K. V. Ramana Reddy v. Rasthriya Ispat Nigam Ltd. (2023) SCC OnLine AP 398, wherein it was held that an application under Section 29A of the Act could be moved only before the Court 'having authority under Section 11 of the Act'.

### Functus Officio Principle

The Court opined that if a court making a reference under Section 11(6) of the Act became functus officio, the question of seeking an extension in terms of Section 29A of the Act from the High Court or the Supreme Court, assuming that it had passed the initial order of reference, would not arise except where the High Court was vested with original jurisdiction, which in any case the Andhra Pradesh High Court was not vested with.

### Interpretation of 'Court' under Section 2(1)(e)

The Court opined that it was settled law that while interpreting a definition, a construction which would defeat or was likely to defeat the purpose of the Act had to be ignored. Considering the provisions of Section 29A of the Act, the Court stated that it did not find that the expression 'Court' used therein, required to be given contextually a different meaning than the definition of 'Court' under Section 2(1)(e) of the Act.

### Decision

Thus, the Court opined that the present Court, not being a Court within the meaning of Section 2(1)(e) of the Act, had no jurisdiction to entertain an application under Section 29A of the Act, and hence, the present applications were not maintainable. The Court stated that the applicants were open to approach the appropriate forum in accordance with law.
